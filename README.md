# EpicCanvas
WebGL drawArrays Library

# Create a canvas
Easy.
```js
const width=640
const height=480
const mySuperEpicCanvas=new EpicCanvas(width,height,"body")
```
EpicCanvas constructor takes 3 arguments:
* width: canvas width
* height: canvas height
* container selector: the canvas element created will be appended as a child to this container.

This will create an EpicCanvas object which contains the following important properties:
* canvas: a canvas
* gl: a webGL context
* and more!

# Load textures
Textures can be loaded into the EpicCanvas with either one of these methods:
* loadTexture(url): loads one texture
* loadTextures([url1,url2,...,urln]): loads many textures

Textures are pushed sequentially into the EpicCanvas.textures array.
Textures can be used even when not fully loaded. A blue pixel will be used during loading time.
